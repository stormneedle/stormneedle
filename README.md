- 👋 Hi, I’m @stormneedle. Either the lost needle in the middle of an electrical storm or something else. Probably else.
- 👀 I’ve been interested in PDP-11/45, Alpha/VAX, Itanium ... on hardware and C, C++, Snobol, LISP, MUMPS, SQL, R and Python in software. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. This is still new to me.
